VERSION HISTORY:

v0.01
-initial release

v0.02
-added gun and bullets

v0.03
-added crates and raycasts for wallhit sound. modified tile detector code to allow for NONE behavior when airborn
(currently disabled as it would remove the cool bounce mechanic--would have to re-code that somehow.) Made bullets position not tied to player.

v0.04
-player can trigger area entered events when touching other objects such as the tilemap or a crates -- for example lvl 2 gravity flip via crate (FIXED--this was due to a bug in the Collectable script which I deleted.)
-added movement for crates
-destroy crates when they hit a spike (added terrain detector to crate)
-allow player to move while under a crate (maybe later... it's not a bug it's a feature now)

v0.05
-added restart game
-added Nathan (dialogue) and gun item as pickup

v0.06
-player can now move under crates (area2d, collision layer method.)
-new game dialogue for nathan
-removed old code / nodes on crate that weren't being used

v0.07
-added VERSION CONTROL (GIT)
-fixed an issue where controller input would lag/stutter the game. Removed all controller input for now.
-animated sprite for nathan
-parallax / game background for levels
-updated base scene nodes and drawing order

v0.08
-sound fx for dialogue (DONE--could edit later to add sounds for characters)
-refactored player code... it was a mess
-prevent moving during nathan's dialogue
-refeined hitboxes for dialogue and new options based on crate position, player height, and player overlap

v0.09

========================================================================================

General dev notes:
-actionables are attached to characters in the scene in the editor, since their actions may depend on the scene
-the export variables allow you to attach dialogue resources and starts to that specific instance/scene

========================================================================================

v0.10
-gradient code update for nocturne
-more variation in nocturne art (colors, patterns etc. past 39 seconds.)
-fixed bug, spike sometimes don't kill if colliding with regular ground tiles (example--level 2 left side), added code to detect which types of terrain are being collided with and special logic for spike collision

TODO:

BUGS:
-crate sometimes shoots out from under you really fast, don't really know why

FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS:
-velocity boost from gun bullets
-new tiles (water, air)
-new pickups (rotate left, rotate right)
-enemies


OTHER:
#-replay value--highscore/alternate routes/unlocks?
#-move jump code inside physics, only check for input on unhandled input
#-nathan dialogue for shooting / falling off left side?
#-can sometimes cheese the detection zone for NPC dialogue -- not really a big deal
#-fix weird single pixel layer offset for player ground collisions and crates in fullscreen -- doesn't happen on itch.io
#-normalization error randomly occurs in move_and_slide (very rare.)
#-sometimes wallhit sound still does not play (very rare.)
#-pictures for control instructions instead of text (more concise) -- nah, looks weird

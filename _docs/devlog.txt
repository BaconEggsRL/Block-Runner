v0.01 -- initial release
v0.02 -- added gun and bullets
v0.03 -- added crates and raycasts for wallhit sound. modified tile detector code to allow for NONE behavior when airborn

v0.04 -- 
bugs fixed:
-player can trigger area entered events when touching other objects such as the tilemap or a crates: for example lvl 2 gravity flip via crate (FIXED--this was due to a bug in the Collectable script which I deleted.)
features added:
-added movement for crates
-destroy crates when they hit a spike (DONE--added terrain detector to crate)
-allow player to move while under a crate (maybe later... it's not a bug it's a feature now)

v0.05 --
-added restart game
-added Nathan (dialogue) and gun item as pickup

v0.06 --
bugs fixed:

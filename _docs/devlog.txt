v0.01
-initial release

v0.02
-added gun and bullets

v0.03
-added crates and raycasts for wallhit sound. modified tile detector code to allow for NONE behavior when airborn
(currently disabled as it would remove the cool bounce mechanic--would have to re-code that somehow.) Made bullets position not tied to player.

v0.04
-player can trigger area entered events when touching other objects such as the tilemap or a crates: for example lvl 2 gravity flip via crate (FIXED--this was due to a bug in the Collectable script which I deleted.)
features added:
-added movement for crates
-destroy crates when they hit a spike (added terrain detector to crate)
-allow player to move while under a crate (maybe later... it's not a bug it's a feature now)

v0.05
-added restart game
-added Nathan (dialogue) and gun item as pickup

v0.06
-player can now move under crates (area2d, collision layer method.)
-new game dialogue for nathan
-removed old code / nodes on crate that weren't being used

v0.07
-added VERSION CONTROL (GIT)
-fixed an issue where controller input would lag/stutter the game. Removed all controller input for now.
-animated sprite for nathan
-parallax / game background for levels
-updated base scene nodes and drawing order

v0.08
-sound fx for dialogue (DONE--could edit later to add sounds for characters)
-refactored player code... it was a mess
-prevent moving during nathan's dialogue
-refeined hitboxes for dialogue and new options based on crate position, player height, and player overlap

v0.09
-added more dialogue options
-added label tips to show player controls
-added nocturne cutscene for falling off edge
-background music

========================================================================================

general dev notes:
-actionables are attached to characters in the scene in the editor, since their actions may depend on the scene
-the export variables allow you to attach dialogue resources and starts to that specific instance/scene

========================================================================================

TODO:
-fix bug where spike don't kill if colliding with regular ground tiles
-fix bug where you can still slide into NPC but claustrophobic is not detected

-velocity boost from gun bullets
-move jump code inside physics, only check for input on unhandled input

OTHER:
#-fix weird single pixel layer offset for player ground collisions and crates in fullscreen -- nah, doesn't happen on itch.io
#-make nathan collideable / shootable? -- nah, feels wrong
#-prevent moving while dialogue? -- nah, feels wrong




bugs to fix:
-normalization error randomly occurs in move_and_slide
	E 0:01:31:0218   player.gd:89 @ _physics_process(): The normal Vector2 must be normalized.
  <C++ Error>    Condition "!p_normal.is_normalized()" is true. Returning: Vector2()
  <C++ Source>   core/math/vector2.cpp:165 @ slide()
  <Stack Trace>  player.gd:89 @ _physics_process()
-sometimes wallhit sound still does not play? (very rare.)

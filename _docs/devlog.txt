General dev notes:
-actionables are attached to characters in the scene in the editor, since their actions may depend on the scene
-the export variables allow you to attach dialogue resources and starts to that specific instance/scene

VERSION HISTORY:

v0.01
-initial release

v0.02
-added gun and bullets

v0.03
-added crates and raycasts for wallhit sound. modified tile detector code to allow for NONE behavior when airborn
(currently disabled as it would remove the cool bounce mechanic--would have to re-code that somehow.) Made bullets position not tied to player.

v0.04
-player can trigger area entered events when touching other objects such as the tilemap or a crates -- for example lvl 2 gravity flip via crate (FIXED--this was due to a bug in the Collectable script which I deleted.)
-added movement for crates
-destroy crates when they hit a spike (added terrain detector to crate)
-allow player to move while under a crate (maybe later... it's not a bug it's a feature now)

v0.05
-added restart game
-added Nathan (dialogue) and gun item as pickup

v0.06
-player can now move under crates (area2d, collision layer method.)
-new game dialogue for nathan
-removed old code / nodes on crate that weren't being used

v0.07
-added VERSION CONTROL (GIT)
-fixed an issue where controller input would lag/stutter the game. Removed all controller input for now.
-animated sprite for nathan
-parallax / game background for levels
-updated base scene nodes and drawing order

v0.08
-sound fx for dialogue (DONE--could edit later to add sounds for characters)
-refactored player code... it was a mess
-prevent moving during nathan's dialogue
-refeined hitboxes for dialogue and new options based on crate position, player height, and player overlap

v0.09
-added more dialogue options
-added label tips to show player controls
-added nocturne cutscene for falling off edge
-background music

v0.10
-gradient code update for nocturne
-more variation in nocturne art (colors, patterns etc. past 39 seconds.)
-fixed bug, spike sometimes don't kill if colliding with regular ground tiles (example--level 2 left side), added code to detect which types of terrain are being collided with and special logic for spike collision
-modified balloon code for custom actionable input and skip
-modified tip labels

v0.11
-save nathan_mad state (done--can only reset by beating game or clearing cache now.)
-added nathan dialogue for nocturne
-added nathan dialogue for missing music 

v0.12
- fixed bug where forces applied to crate cause it to lose contact with the ground momentarily, causing it to sometimes rotate unexpectedly. this was caused by issues with tilemap collisions on the borders between tiles.
This is a documented issue with godot for rigidbodies -- github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/47148
The solution was to implement a baked collision shape so that the boundaries between tiles are no longer an issue. -- github.com/popcar2/GodotTilemapBaker

- fixed bug where player movement stuttered when moving out from underneath a box near the corners (border of crate_detector).
I assumed this was caused by the crate_detector changing the physics layers but the issues seems to have resolved itself when fixing the above bug?

- fixed bug where you could get stuck moving across crates on the corners?
certain gaps between crates cannot be traversed across. player just gets stuck. likely due to requirement of raycast to apply force to crates
removed raycast check--seems like no adverse effects. can't replicate bug anymore in test level
Mark as fixed for now? Could also have something to do with crates not being on level ground.

- minor update, saving this version before messing with native source code

OTHER:

<C++ Source>   core/math/vector2.cpp:165 @ slide()



#-fix bugs: 
-crates jitter side to side when pushing them
-force applied to 2 crates seems less than it should be
-player force applied to crates sometimes causes it to shoot out really fast
#-normalization error randomly occurs in move_and_slide (very rare.)


-speedup on top of crates that are moving
	I think what is happening here is that when the player pushes the box, it goes about as fast as player speed
	Then when the player jumps and lands on the platform, if you don't move at all you just slide along at the same speed as the box.
	So if you try to move it applies the normal speed, plus the box speed, making you move twice as fast.
	Not sure if this is good behavior or not--will have to think about it
#-replay value--highscore/alternate routes/unlocks?
#-camera/resolution scaling is not pixel perfect.
#-move jump code inside physics, only check for input on unhandled input -- not causing any problems
#-can sometimes cheese the detection zone for NPC dialogue -- not really a big deal
#-fix weird single pixel layer offset for player ground collisions and crates in fullscreen -- doesn't happen on itch.io
#-sometimes wallhit sound still does not play (very rare.)
